# SIEM System Project Overview

## 1. Objective

The project aims to develop a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system for real-time monitoring and analysis of security events. It focuses on handling logs received through UDP, parsing them, and storing them in a **MongoDB** database.

## 2. Components

### UDP Server (`server.py`)
- **Functionality:**
  - Listens for logs on a specified UDP port.
  - Rotates between two log files (`window_logs.csv` and `window_logs2.csv`) to manage log storage.
  - Parses incoming logs and writes them to the respective log file.

### Parser (`parsing.py`)
- **Functionality:**
  - Parses logs from different sources (Linux and Mac logs in this case).
  - Extracts relevant fields using regular expressions.
  - Inserts parsed data into a MongoDB database (`project_db`).

### Frontend 
- The frontend is developed using **React.js**.
- It will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the parsed logs.
- Users can view logs, apply filters, and perform other actions through the UI.

### Backend 
- The backend is developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- It will handle communication with the **MongoDB** database.
- Provides API endpoints for the frontend to fetch and interact with log data.

## 3. Flow of Data
1. Logs are generated by various sources and sent over **UDP** to the server.
2. The **UDP server (`server.py`)** receives logs, rotates log files, and parses them using regular expressions.
3. Parsed logs are inserted into a **MongoDB** database using the **parser (`parsing.py`)**.
4. The frontend interacts with the backend to fetch log data from the database and provides a user interface for users to visualize and analyze the logs.

## 4. Improvements
- Introduce **multithreading** for concurrent log processing.
- Implement a more structured and modular code architecture.
- Enhance security measures and error handling.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `server.py`
This file acts as the **UDP server** that receives logs and manages the rotation of log files.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Socket Programming:** Uses the `socket` module to create a **UDP socket**.
- **File Handling:** Writes incoming logs to rotating log files (`window_logs.csv` and `window_logs2.csv`).
- **Infinite Loop:** Continuously listens for incoming logs in an infinite loop.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Enhance **error handling** to handle exceptions more gracefully.
- Modularize the code further for better maintainability.

### 2. `parsing.py`
This file is responsible for **parsing logs** and inserting them into a **MongoDB** database.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Regular Expressions:** Utilizes regular expressions to extract relevant fields from logs.
- **MongoDB Interaction:** Uses the `pymongo` library to interact with a **MongoDB** database.
- **Error Handling:** Catches exceptions during parsing to ensure smooth execution.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Modularize the code further for better readability.
- Add comments to explain complex sections for better understanding.

### 3. `parsing_mac_linux.py`
This file provides similar functionality to `parsing.py` but is tailored for **Mac** and **Linux** logs.

#### Key Concepts:
- Similar to `parsing.py` but with specific regular expressions tailored for **Mac** and **Linux** logs.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Consider merging the functionalities of `parsing.py` and `parsing_mac_linux.py` into a single, more versatile parser.
- Ensure consistent code structure and naming conventions.
