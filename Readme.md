Project Overview:
1. Objective:

The project aims to develop a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time monitoring and analysis of security events. It focuses on handling logs received through UDP, parsing them, and storing them in a MongoDB database.

2. Components:
UDP Server (server.py):

Listens for logs on a specified UDP port.
Rotates between two log files (window_logs.csv and window_logs2.csv) to manage log storage.
Parses incoming logs and writes them to the respective log file.
Parser (parsing.py):

Parses logs from different sources (Linux and Mac logs in this case).
Extracts relevant fields using regular expressions.
Inserts parsed data into a MongoDB database (project_db).
Frontend (To Be Provided):

The frontend is expected to be developed using React.js.
It will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the parsed logs.
Users can view logs, apply filters, and perform other actions through the UI.
Backend (To Be Provided):

The backend is expected to be developed using Node.js and Express.js.
It will handle communication with the MongoDB database.
Provides API endpoints for the frontend to fetch and interact with log data.
3. Flow of Data:

Logs are generated by various sources and sent over UDP to the server.
The UDP server (server.py) receives logs, rotates log files, and parses them using regular expressions.
Parsed logs are then inserted into a MongoDB database using the parser (parsing.py).
The frontend interacts with the backend to fetch log data from the database and provides a user interface for users to visualize and analyze the logs.
4. Improvements:

The project can be further improved by introducing multithreading for concurrent log processing.
Implementing a more structured and modular code architecture.
Enhancing security measures and error handling.

1. server.py
This file acts as the UDP server that receives logs and manages the rotation of log files.

Key Concepts:

Socket Programming: Uses the socket module to create a UDP socket.
File Handling: Writes incoming logs to rotating log files (window_logs.csv and window_logs2.csv).
Infinite Loop: Continuously listens for incoming logs in an infinite loop.
Possible Improvements:

Error handling could be enhanced to handle exceptions more gracefully.
Code could be modularized further for better maintainability.
2. parsing.py
This file is responsible for parsing logs and inserting them into a MongoDB database.

Key Concepts:

Regular Expressions: Utilizes regular expressions to extract relevant fields from logs.
MongoDB Interaction: Uses the pymongo library to interact with a MongoDB database.
Error Handling: Catches exceptions during parsing to ensure smooth execution.
Possible Improvements:

The code is structured and functional, but you might consider modularizing it further for readability.
Adding comments to explain complex sections could enhance understanding.
3. parsing_mac_linux.py
This file appears to have similar functionality to parsing.py but is tailored for Mac and Linux logs.

Key Concepts:

Similar to parsing.py but with specific regular expressions tailored for Mac and Linux logs.
Possible Improvements:

Consider merging the functionalities of parsing.py and parsing_mac_linux.py into a single, more versatile parser.
Ensure consistent code structure and naming conventions.
